You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An House is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an House is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an Neighbours in grid. If there is no Neighbours, return 0.
